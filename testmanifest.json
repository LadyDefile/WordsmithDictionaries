"""Hello! This is Wordsmith's new notice system.
I'll only use this in the future for important things like feature updates or discovered bugs.
With that in mind, here are a cool new feature to notice with this update!
* You can now use /scratchpad (name) to create a scratchpad with a custom name!
  
And I fixed several bugs as well:
* The close button in Settings will now listen to the 'Confirm Scratch Pad Delete' setting.
* The web manifest and dictionary files will only be loaded a single time now instead of 3 times.
* Fixed a bug that could cause 'Confirm Delete Scratch Pads' setting to get changed accidentally"""
