    "Hello! This is Wordsmith's new notice system.\nI'll only use this in the future for important things like feature updates or discovered bugs.\nWith that in mind, here are a cool new feature to notice with this update!\n* You can now use /scratchpad (name) to create a scratchpad with a custom name!\n    And I fixed several bugs as well:\n* The close button in Settings will now listen to the 'Confirm Scratch Pad Delete' setting.\n* The web manifest and dictionary files will only be loaded a single time now instead of 3 times.\n* Fixed a bug that could cause 'Confirm Delete Scratch Pads' setting to get changed accidentally"
