    "I need to apologize. I made a small mistake with a single line of code that cost you all\ninsane amounts of performance. I'm talking about going from hundreds of FPS to maybe 60.\nThis was entirely my fault and I want you to know that I have FIXED this issue. You\nshould now see next to no performance loss when using Wordsmith. Again, I cannot apologize\nenough for this. Thank you to everyone who used Wordsmith in spite of this glaring issue."
